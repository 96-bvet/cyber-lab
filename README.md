# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab Template

Welcome to the Cybersecurity Lab Template! This project is designed to help students build hands-on experience in cybersecurity by creating their own lab environments using WSL, Podman, and Hyper-V.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Simulate real-world systems and networks for monitoring and analysis
- Practice threat detection, incident response, and log analysis
- Collaborate using GitHub workflows and project management
- Showcase individual lab projects as part of a cybersecurity portfolio

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** – Lightweight Linux environment
- **Podman** – Container management for deploying services
- **Hyper-V** – Virtual machines for simulating endpoints and servers
- **GitHub** – Version control and collaboration

## 🧪 Lab Modules

Each student or team can build custom labs using modules like:
- Network Monitoring with Suricata
- Log Analysis with ELK Stack
- Windows Sysmon + Event Logging
- Threat Hunting with Sigma Rules
- Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS
